# Property Details Application

This is a react native app that displays the property details.

* Run `yarn` to install all the dependencies
* Run `yarn start` to run the project and choose appropriate device to run it on.(I have tested only on ios simulator due to time restrictions)
* Run `yarn test` to run unit tests.
